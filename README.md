# Stolen-Bars-News


### Overview

In this project, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But i did not actually write any articles; instead, I flex my Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site. In this case yahoo.com.

### Purpose of Project

In this project I was Keen to use;

   1. express

   2. mongoose

   3. cheerio

   4. axios

The reason for tis project was to gain exprerince scrapping websites for information.

Future Updates
At the moment, the app will check your survey results against a seed file with results from various fake "friends." In the future, I would like to add in a database in order to have users match against one another instead of the seed file.
