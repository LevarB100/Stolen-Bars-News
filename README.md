# Stolen-Bars-News


### Overview

In this project, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But i did not actually write any articles; instead, I flex my Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site. In this case yahoo.com.

### Purpose of Project

In this project I was Keen to use;

   1. express

   2. mongoose

   3. cheerio

   4. axios

The reason for tis project was to gain exprerince scrapping websites for information.

### Future Updates
At the moment the app only scrapes yahoo.com. In the future I would like to make were the application will scrape multiple websites and to be able to organize the information received so I can offer it to the user by subject matter.
